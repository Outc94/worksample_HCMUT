# Work Sample for Educational Mentor (Machine Learning Engineer Course)

## Overview

In the work sample for the Machine Learning Engineer course, you will be asked to work on two tasks that simulate mentorship.

- Mentoring question handling
- Responding to issues and creating improvement plans

### Basic principles of approach

The basic principles of how to tackle the work samples will be presented.  

- To be kind and polite to students
- Teach in such a way that students can become independent after graduation.
- To take into account the language and level of the student that is not explained in advance.

### Questions about the initiative

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask the work sample supervisor.  
You can use the study rooms and classrooms of DIVE INTO CODE if it is to work on the work samples. Please use them proactively.

### Prerequisite knowledge

DIVE INTO CODE hires people who can catch up with the necessary knowledge even if they have no experience, and who can keep doing so.  
It would be ideal if you have current knowledge, but even if you have completely zero knowledge, we provide you with the opportunity to challenge yourself.  
If you have no knowledge at all, this is a great opportunity to see how far you can take your knowledge.  

For those who do not have the knowledge at the moment, we will give you recommended study materials.

## Mentoring Question Response

The first work sample is a mentoring question response.

A student in the first week of the course asks in class, "I tried to calculate the dot product in Python using NumPy, but I got an error. Why is this happening? Please explain in writing how you would respond to this situation.

Assume that you have the following prerequisite information.

- The person who asked this question has very little experience with Python or college-level mathematics.
- The course will have many opportunities to work with arrays in NumPy in the future

**The code that was executed**

```py
import numpy as np

a = np.array([[-1,2,3]])
b = np.array([[0,2,1]])
np.dot(a,b)
```

### Publish your writing to Github.

Create a Github repository called `worksample`, and make the text you created available on `Github` with the file name `1_mentoring.md`.

## Responding to issues and creating improvement plans

The next work sample is to answer the questions and create improvement plans. You will be asked to answer the following two types of questions and create an improvement plan.

- A Introduction to Python assignment Let's try to use Python
- B Sprint10 Assignment Deep Learning Scratch Neural Networks

Use Jupyter Notebook to write the Python code and Markdown description in an ipynb file, or use Google Colaboratory if you don't have access to Jupyter Notebook.

[DIVER | Introduction to Python 0: Using Google Colaboratory](https://diver.diveintocode.jp/curriculums/1499)

The assignment answers should be written with the expectation that they will be distributed to the students. Rather than simply writing the answer, it is good to include the following information, for example

- Points that are easy to make mistakes
- Alternative solutions
- Developmental content

You are also expected to improve this assignment itself in parallel with the preparation of your response. Please describe your improvement plan in the same ipynb file in terms of the following. This is the text you will communicate to the members you will work with.

- Suggested descriptions or questions that would be good to add
- Suggestions for correcting incomprehensible or inappropriate descriptions

**Explanation of each task**

- A Python Introductory Assignment Let's try to use Python.

https://github.com/DiveintoCode-corp/worksample/blob/master/ml_intro.md

English version: https://diver.diveintocode.jp/curriculums/1385

These assignments are used for introductory Python seminars and as prep for full-time courses. It is intended to be solved in an hour or less at most.

This assignment and the introductory textbook are available for free at the following page.

- B Sprint10 assignment Deep Learning Scratch Neural Networks

https://github.com/DiveintoCode-corp/worksample/blob/master/ml_sprint10.md

English version: https://diver.diveintocode.jp/curriculums/1876

This is an assignment that takes two days to solve in the classroom during the second month of the course. This is the students' first exposure to neural networks. After linear regression, logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, and K-means, this is the sixth scratch assignment, so the students are already familiar with the basic aspects of supervised learning. The next task is "Sprint 11: Deep Learning Scratch Deep Neural Networks", where we will extend the neural network class created here.

### Publish your writing to Github.

In the Github repository `worksample`, create a file named `2_example_answer.ipynb` with the answers and improvement plans you have created so that they can be viewed on `Github`. If you have created answers for more than one issue, please give them distinct names.

## Presentation Method

Please submit the URL of your Github repository that reflects what you have worked on above.  
Please note that you should make sure that all of the following items are met before submitting.  

- [ ] `1_mentoring.md` contains a written description of how to respond to mentoring questions.
- [ ] `2_example_answer.ipynb` contains answers and improvement suggestions.

### Deadline for submission

The deadline for submission is by the deadline if you were able to talk about it during the hiring interview. If not, please decide by yourself.  

This concludes the work sample.  
Thank you for your time.
